This repository takes a demo from the [TransformerLens]](https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/content/tutorials.html) documentation, specifically the demo regarding Grokking on modular addition, and attempts to build that repository out with some more documentation.The notebook can be found at the root of the repository.

The added commentary covers the basics of grokking with citations and references up to the model analysis portion. The latter portions of the demo delve fairly deeply into the mathematics of what the model learned to do (The Fourier Multiplication Algorithm) and there are linked videos for that provided.
